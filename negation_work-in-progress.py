# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed

# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python

# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 



import numpy as np # linear algebra

import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)



# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.

# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

#print(check_output(["ls", "../input"]).decode("utf8"))

_max = X_train.values.max()

_min = X_train.values.min()

mean = X_train.values.mean()

print('max={} min={} mean={}'.format(_max, _min, mean))

#This tells us that values of features we get for free seem to be normalized already 
import matplotlib.image as mpimg       # reading images to numpy arrays

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt        # to plot any graph

import matplotlib.patches as mpatches  # to draw a circle at the mean contour



from skimage import measure            # to find shape contour

import scipy.ndimage as ndi            # to determine shape centrality



# matplotlib setup
